## Christopher Harrop

I'm a Junior Full Stack Web-Developer and former British Army Officer with 10yrs experience in leadership, analytics and sales operations. I used my 6yrs in the Financial Services to shape sales decisions with insight and metrics. Now I want to use my skills to ~~break~~ make stuff.

I'm looking for a Full Stack junior development role where I can continue to shape the direction of a dynamic, data driven company.
