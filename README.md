## Christopher Harrop

I'm a Junior Full Stack Web-Developer and former British Army Officer with 10yrs experience in leadership, analytics and sales operations. I employ a consultative approach to Financial Services Sales to shape investment decisions through insight and metrics. Now I want to channel my skills and experience into ~~breaking~~ making stuff.

I'm looking for a Full Stack, junior development role where I can leverage my unique skillset and continue to shape the direction of a dynamic, data driven company.
